# AlexNet in PyTorch

AlexNet is one of the most influential convolutional neural networks (CNNs), introduced by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton in the groundbreaking paper titled **"ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks"** at NeurIPS 2012. It played a pivotal role in popularizing deep learning by achieving a significant performance improvement on the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) 2012.

## üß† About AlexNet

- Introduced in 2012
- Won the ImageNet competition by a large margin
- Comprises 5 convolutional layers, 3 fully connected layers, ReLU activations, max-pooling, and dropout
- Utilized GPUs for training long before it became standard

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes

- The model expects input size of `(3, 227, 227)`
- You can modify the output layer (`output_classes`) to suit your dataset (e.g., 10 for CIFAR-10)
- Includes weight initialization and model summary via `torchinfo`
